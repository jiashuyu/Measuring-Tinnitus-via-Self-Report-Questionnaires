    "Cronbach's Alpha is the dominant measure of scale reliability in psychology and the social sciences. It can be found in almost every quantitative empirical study, which shows its importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we use multiple items to measure a latent (non-observable) construct, we call this set of items a scale. For instance, in a buisiness context, we would like to find out our customers' attitude towards a product, which is a very helpful piece of information for marketers. However, a lot of the time we cannot measure attitude directly. One way to get data on this is to simply ask customers \"What is your attitude towards this product?\", but the catch is that we will not get reliable results in this way because it is up to the customers to define what attitude actually is. Alternatively, we should define the construct ourselves and attempt to measure it using multiple, objective and observable measures. For example, if a customer rates a product as \"good\", \"interesting\", \"exciting\", and \"useful\", that might be a measure of attitude, although the word \"attitude\" itself was not being used. In this case, we can use these four questions as a scale that measures attitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make sure we did a good job at constructing the scale, we need to use some quality measures. Generally, we would like to test a scale for validity and reliability. Specifically, a scale is valid if it actually measures the construct it is supposed to measure. It is reliable if it measures the same thing every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is where Cronbach's Alpha comes into rescue. Cronbach's Alpha measures the reliability of a dataset. In other words, it demonstrates the internal consistency of our scale. This is the degree to which all items in a scale measure the same construct. If \"good\", \"interesting\", \"exciting\", and \"useful\" all contribute to measuring the same thing, Cronbach's Alpha will be high. On the other hand, if we tried to measure attitude using \"tasty\", \"rich\", \"cold\", and \"anixous\", Cronbach's Alpha would be very low, because the items do not even lining up. And this is exactly what Cronbach's Alpha helps us with. It reflects whether the items we picked to measure a construct line up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cronbach's Alpha ranges between 0 and 1. A higher value indicates a higher internal consistency. Generally, a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.7 or more is considered acceptable. The formula for Cronbach's Alpha is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha=\\dfrac{N\\cdot \\bar{r}}{1+(N-1)\\cdot \\bar{r}}$$ where $N$ is the number of questions and $\\bar{r}$ is the mean correlation between the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this in Python, we need to first transform the dataframe input into a correlation matrix. Then we can calculate $N$ and $\\bar{r}$ before using the formula to calculate Cronbach's Alpha. The code is shown below. As a result, we got a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.968 for TFI questionnaire, 0.921 for THI questionnaire, and 0.950 for TPFQ questionnaire, which are all exceptional!"
